A web-based visual editor for creating PowerPoint presentations using a node-based interface. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, React Flow, and PptxGenJS.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Visual Slide Editor**: Use a node-based interface (powered by React Flow) to add, arrange, and visualize your presentation slides.
- **Detailed Slide Properties**: Select a slide node to edit its title, choose a layout (affecting available content areas), and input text into up to four distinct content areas via a properties panel.
- **Toolbar Actions**:
  - Add new slides.
  - Automatically arrange slides using Dagre.js (`Auto Layout`).
  - Save the current presentation state to browser local storage (`Save`).
  - Load the previously saved state from local storage (`Load`).
  - Export the visual layout directly into a `.pptx` file using PptxGenJS (`Export PPTX`). Slides are ordered based on their vertical position.
  - Access application settings (`Settings`).
- **Layer-Based Editing**:
  - **Layer Panel**: Select a slide node to view its layers (background, title, text, media, etc.) in a hierarchical tree view on the left panel.
  - **Properties Panel**: Select a layer in the Layer Panel to edit its specific properties (name, content, position, size, text format, media URL, etc.) on the right panel.
  - **Direct Manipulation**: Directly drag layers within a slide node on the canvas to change their position. Select a layer to reveal resize handles and drag them to adjust its size.
  - **Add Layers**: Add new text or image layers to the selected slide via buttons in the Layer Panel.
- **PPTX Export**: Export your visual layout directly into a `.pptx` file. Slides are ordered based on their vertical position in the editor. Layouts and content from the properties panel are included.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Save your work in the browser and reload it later.
- **Custom Controls & Minimap**: Enhanced canvas navigation with zoom controls, node focusing, and a minimap overview.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite for a fast development experience.
